# notifications-via-webscraping
This is an awesome project which will allow you to change your apps functionality as u wish .
This jutsu(naruto fan) requires webscraping . The data from your webpage basically a html page is scraped using *jsoup* library .
then that data is processed on your app. Since you have background service running on your device in this case its
Testservice.java this would scrape,analyse and process the data as you need it .
One fine example would be notifications.i.e, if you want to observe a change in an website and get notified about that change in background you can use this project

However the con of using this method would be excess battery usage
you can overcome this by varying timertask or making a count and putting a if else statement

#note
change the address of this repo of the html page that is http://192.168.38.43/balk.html to your address where your html page is saved. =)
