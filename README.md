# notifications-via-webscraping
This is an awesome project which will allow you to change your apps functionality as u wish .
This jutsu(naruto fan) requires webscraping . The data from your webpage basically a html page is scraped using *jsoup* library .
then that data is processed on your app. Since you have background service running on your device in this case its
Testservice.java this would scrape,analyse and process the data as you need it .
One fine example would be notifications.
sometimes when you find it difficult to handle firebase and google cloud in order to send notification to the device
you can simply use this technique.

However the con of using this method would be excess battery usage
you can overcome this by varying timertask or making a count and putting a if else statement

#note
change the address of this repo of the html page that is http://192.168.38.43/balk.html to your address where your html page is saved. =)

enjoy an alternate for firebase and google cloud computing
